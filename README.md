## Best Artworks of All Time

This project contains my solution for the final Data Science project at Spiced Academy.

### Challenge description

...

### Dataset

The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it was scraped from [artchallenge.ru](http://artchallenge.ru/).

It includes:

* a csv file: a dataset of information of each artist â€“ used it for data exploration and visualization. It was the first part of my presentation 
* an images.zip: a collection of full-size images, divided into folders by painters, used this part of the dataset to build a model to predict the artist. 

It is an imbalanced dataset. The model was trained on 38 painters who have a minimum of 80 paintings each.

Used ... :

* ImageDataGenerator

* Class_weights

* pre-defined model(ResNet50) as baseline, with pre-trained weights (imagnet)
