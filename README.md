Best Artworks of All Time – final Data Science project at Spiced Academy 

The dataset is from Kaggle, it was scraped from artchellenge.ru 

It includes

* a csv file: a dataset of information of each artist – used it for data exploration and visualization. It was the first part of my presentation 
* an images.zip: a collection of full-size images, divided into folders by painters, used this part of the dataset to build a model to predict the artist. 

It is an imbalanced dataset. The model trained for 38 artists, painters who have a minimum of 80 paintings.

Used :

•        ImageDataGenerator

•        Class_weights

•        pre-defined model(ResNet50) as baseline, with pre-trained weights (imagnet)
